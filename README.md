# clj-nio

A wrapper around the java.nio.file namespace. This is a rework of [nio.file](https://github.com/ToBeReplaced/nio.file)
to suit my needs and style preferences...

## Installation
```clojure
{io.github.jerems/clj-nio {:git/tag "v70", :git/sha "2a9e1b4512"}}
```

## Mentions
Thanks to:
- [nio.file](https://github.com/ToBeReplaced/nio.file) from which I have taken a lot of code.
