# clj-nio
A wrapper around the java.nio.file namespace. This is a rework of [nio.file](https://github.com/ToBeReplaced/nio.file)
to suit my needs and style preferences...  

## Mentions
Thanks to:
- [nio.file](https://github.com/ToBeReplaced/nio.file) from which I have taken a lot of code.
- [potemkin](https://github.com/ztellman/potemkin) from which I picked the namespace importing logic.
